# Examples

File names starting with `example` are used to test the scheme, we take very simple cases
which are not full scale benchmarks to quickly test our scheme, if it is working as expected.

# Benchmarks

File names starting with `benchmark` are from journal papers, and these are to validate our
scheme.
